0x1D. C - Binary trees

Here in this project I have learned about tree, binary trees, binary search tree data sstructure algorithm and practiced binary search tree implementation using C programming language.

The concepts and practical implementations about this project are:
1. binary tree
2. Data Structure and Algorithms - Tree
3. Tree Traversal
4. Binary Search Tree
5. Data structures: Binary Tree
6. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
7. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
